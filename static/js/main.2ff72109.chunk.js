You regain all expended spell slots when you finish<span> a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list.

Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of pre<span>pared spells.</span></p>\r\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell <span>on your list.</span></p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.

You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p>\r\n<p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn&rsquo;t stand on its own&mdash;it&rsquo;s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p>\r\n<p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don&rsquo;t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family&rsquo;s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p>\r\n<p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p>\r\n<p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p>\r\n<p>A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span>you put it on).</span></p>\r\n<p>As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart &mdash; in a chaste sort of devotion.

Those with fewer hit points are more fragile. \n\nA creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing. \n\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points."},{id:39,name:"Hit Dice",description:"Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).\n\nAt 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier.)"},{id:40,name:"Proficiency Bonus",description:'<p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/step-by-step-characters" rel="nofollow">chapter 1</a>. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p>\r\n<p>Your proficiency bonus can&rsquo;t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.</p>\r\n<p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue&rsquo;s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.</p>\r\n<p>By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn&rsquo;t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don&rsquo;t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.</p>\r\n<p>In general, you don&rsquo;t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.</p>'},{id:41,name:"Ability Scores",description:"Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability. \n\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30. \n\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30."},{id:42,name:"Alignment",description:"A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations."},{id:43,name:"Lawful Good",description:"Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good."},{id:44,name:"Neutral Good",description:"Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good."},{id:45,name:"Chaotic Good",description:"Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good."},{id:46,name:"Neutral",description:"Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don\u2019t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral."},{id:47,name:"Lawful Evil",description:"Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil."},{id:48,name:"Neutral Evil",description:"Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil."},{id:49,name:"Chaotic Evil",description:"Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil."},{id:50,name:"Lawful Neutral",description:"Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral."},{id:51,name:"Chaotic Neutral",description:"Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral."},{id:52,name:"Background",description:"Every story has a beginning. Your character\u2019s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester."},{id:53,name:"Personality Traits",description:"Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out.\n\nPersonality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character\u2019s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores."},{id:54,name:"Bonds",description:"Bonds represent a character\u2019s connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character\u2019s motivations and goals. \n\nBonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?"},{id:55,name:"Ideals",description:"Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system. \n\nIdeals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?"},{id:56,name:"Flaws",description:"Your character\u2019s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness\u2014in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What\u2019s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?"},{id:57,name:"Armor Class",description:"Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however. \n\nWithout armor or a shield, your character\u2019s AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in the Equipment section. Record your AC on your character sheet."},{id:58,name:"Acid Damage",description:"The corrosive spray of an adult black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage."},{id:59,name:"Bludgeoning Damage",description:"Blunt force attacks--hammers, falling, constriction, and the like--deal bludgeoning damage."},{id:60,name:"Cold Damage",description:"The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a young white dragon's breath deal cold damage."},{id:61,name:"Fire Damage",description:"Ancient red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage."},{id:62,name:"Force Damage",description:"Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form.

Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once."},{id:72,name:"Damage Resistance",description:"Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult to hurt with certain types of damage.\n\nIf a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it.\n\nResistance is applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\n\nMultiple instances of resistance that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters."},{id:73,name:"Damage Vulnerability",description:"Some creatures and objects are unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. \n\nIf a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it. \n\nMultiple instances of vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance."},{id:74,name:"Instant Death",description:"Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. \n\nFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies."},{id:75,name:"Death Saving Throws",description:"Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw. \n\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable."},{id:76,name:"Temporary Hit Points",description:"Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury. \n\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage. \n\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points."},{id:77,name:"Saving Throws",description:"<p>A saving throw &mdash; also called a save &mdash; represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don&rsquo;t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p>\r\n<p>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.</p>\r\n<p>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.</p>\r\n<p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p>\r\n<p>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster&rsquo;s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.</p>\r\n<p>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.</p>"},{id:78,name:"Senses (Passive Checks)",description:'<h3 id="PassiveChecks">Passive Checks</h3>\r\n<p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn\'t involve any die rolls.

You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p>\r\n<h4 id="LiftingandCarrying">Lifting and Carrying</h4>\r\n<p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Carrying Capacity.</strong> Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don\'t usually have to worry about it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Push, Drag, or Lift.</strong> You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Size and Strength.</strong> Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature\'s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.</p>\r\n<h4 id="VariantEncumbrance">Variant: Encumbrance</h4>\r\n<p>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment.

The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.</p>\r\n<h5 id="Acrobatics">Acrobatics</h5>\r\n<p>Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you\'re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship\'s deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.</p>\r\n<h5 id="SleightofHand">Sleight of Hand</h5>\r\n<p>Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

Initiative determines the order of creatures\' turns in combat, as described in chapter 9, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/combat#Initiative" rel="nofollow">Combat</a>."</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>HIDING</strong></p>\r\n<p>The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check\'s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.</p>\r\n<p>You can\'t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.</p>\r\n<p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Passive Perception.</strong> When you hide, there\'s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren\'t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature\'s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature\'s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What Can You See?</strong> One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be <strong>lightly</strong> or <strong>heavily obscured&nbsp;</strong>as explained in chapter 8, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/adventuring#VisionandLight" rel="nofollow">Adventuring</a>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>'},{id:3,entityTypeId:1472902489,key:"CON",name:"Constitution",compendiumText:'<p>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p>\r\n<h4 id="ConstitutionChecks">Constitution Checks</h4>\r\n<p>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.</p>\r\n<p>The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Hold your breath</li>\r\n<li>March or labor for hours without rest</li>\r\n<li>Go without sleep</li>\r\n<li>Survive without food or water</li>\r\n<li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 id="HitPoints">Hit Points</h4>\r\n<p>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.</p>\r\n<p>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you\'re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.</p>'},{id:4,entityTypeId:1472902489,key:"INT",name:"Intelligence",compendiumText:'<p>Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.</p>\r\n<h4 id="IntelligenceChecks">Intelligence Checks</h4>\r\n<p>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning.

Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>\r\n<h5 id="Nature">Nature</h5>\r\n<p>Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.</p>\r\n<h5 id="Religion">Religion</h5>\r\n<p>Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.</p>\r\n<h5 id="OtherIntelligenceChecks">Other Intelligence Checks</h5>\r\n<p>The DM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Communicate with a creature without using words</li>\r\n<li>Estimate the value of a precious item</li>\r\n<li>Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard</li>\r\n<li>Forge a document</li>\r\n<li>Recall lore about a craft or trade</li>\r\n<li>Win a game of skill</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 id="SpellcastingAbility">Spellcasting Ability</h4>\r\n<p>Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>'},{id:5,entityTypeId:1472902489,key:"WIS",name:"Wisdom",compendiumText:'<p>Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.</p>\r\n<h4 id="WisdomChecks">Wisdom Checks</h4>\r\n<p>A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone&rsquo;s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person.

You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.</p>\r\n<h5 id="Insight">Insight</h5>\r\n<p>Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone&rsquo;s next move.

It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.</p>\r\n<aside>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>FINDING A HIDDEN OBJECT</strong></p>\r\n<p>When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.</p>\r\n<p>In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</aside>\r\n<h5 id="Survival">Survival</h5>\r\n<p>The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.</p>\r\n<h5 id="OtherWisdomChecks">Other Wisdom Checks</h5>\r\n<p>The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>\r\n<li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 id="SpellcastingAbility">Spellcasting Ability</h4>\r\n<p>Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>'},{id:6,entityTypeId:1472902489,key:"CHA",name:"Charisma",compendiumText:'<p>Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.</p>\r\n<h4 id="CharismaChecks">Charisma Checks</h4>\r\n<p>A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.</p>\r\n<h5 id="Deception">Deception</h5>\r\n<p>Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone\'s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.</p>\r\n<h5 id="Intimidation">Intimidation</h5>\r\n<p>When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.</p>\r\n<h5 id="Performance">Performance</h5>\r\n<p>Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.</p>\r\n<h5 id="Persuasion">Persuasion</h5>\r\n<p>When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.</p>\r\n<h5 id="OtherCharismaChecks">Other Charisma Checks</h5>\r\n<p>The DM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Find the best person to talk to
